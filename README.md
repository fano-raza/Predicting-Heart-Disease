# Predicting Heart Disease

Heart Disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 32% of all deaths. Many different factors are linked to Heart Disease, and in this project I will be exploring how we can use these factors and Machine Learning to predict whether someone will have Heart Disease or not.

I will be using anonymized data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) on over 900 patients to train a **Machine Learning** model to predict a patient's likelihood of having Heart Disease.

**I will be using:**
- **Kaggle** data as the data source
- **Pandas Dataframes** to store the data
- **SciKit Learn** library to create and train the model on the data
