# ❤️🔬 Predicting Heart Disease with Machine Learning

Heart Disease is the **#1 cause of death globally**, responsible for **32% of all deaths**. Early detection can save lives—and that’s where machine learning comes in. This project explores how we can leverage clinical data and predictive modeling to identify individuals at risk of heart disease.

## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, we use **anonymized patient data** from Kaggle to build a machine learning model that predicts whether an individual is likely to have heart disease based on various medical and lifestyle factors.

Our goal: build a reliable classifier that can support early diagnosis and improve healthcare outcomes.

## 🔍 Objectives

- 🧠 Understand key features correlated with heart disease  
- 📊 Analyze and visualize patient data  
- 🤖 Train a machine learning model to predict heart disease risk  
- 🧪 Evaluate model performance and improve accuracy

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- 📂 **Kaggle Dataset** – Anonymized data from 900+ patients  
- 🐼 **Pandas** – For data manipulation and exploration  
- 📈 **Matplotlib** / **Seaborn** – For visualizing trends and insights  
- ⚙️ **Scikit-learn** – For model training and evaluation

## 🤖 Machine Learning Approach

This is a **supervised learning** task using binary classification. We train a model to distinguish between patients **with** and **without** heart disease using medical attributes such as:

- Age  
- Cholesterol levels  
- Resting blood pressure  
- Chest pain type  
- Max heart rate, etc.

We evaluate model performance using standard classification metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
